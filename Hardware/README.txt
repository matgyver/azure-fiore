These files pertain to the shield that fits on the Sparkfun Fio v3.  In 
addition to the shield, you will also need a RN42-XV Bluetooth module that
plugs into the xBee connector on the Fio.  If you want yours battery powered,
a 3.7 V Li-Ion can be plugged into the JST connector.  The Sparkfun Fio is able
to charge the battery through the USB power.
